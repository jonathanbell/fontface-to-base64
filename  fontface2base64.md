fontface2base64
===============
Make a @font-face CSS file and Base64 string from an OpenType or TrueType file. The CSS file can then be used in your project or website.

Usage (command line)
--------------------
```php fontface2base64.php </path/to/font/file.[otf|ttf]> <font-name> <font-style[italic|normal]> <font-weight[300|400|700]>```

There's little to no validation built into the script because you know what you're doing.

OTF or TTF?
